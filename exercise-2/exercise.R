## Exercise 2:  vector functions

### ---------- any and all ----------
### These are very useful utility functions for coding


## Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as argument
## and tells if all numbers are even
## Hint: use modulo operator %% and check out 'all' function


## Pass a vector to test if it works correctly


## Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as argument
## and tells if among all the numbers there is at least one
## odd number
## Hint: check out 'any' function


## Pass a vector to test if it works correctly


### ---------- vector length ----------

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"


## Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
## to check if it works as intended 


# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"


## Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function
## check if it works correctly
