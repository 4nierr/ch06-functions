# Exercise-2

* Simple R functions
* Manipulating vectors, so you have to understand vectors and some
  vector-related functions, such as `length`.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
